### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jere, currently a doctoral candidate at ETH Zurich. I'm interested in sequential decision problems, reinforcement learning, uncertainty quantification, probabilistic (risk-aware) control, economic dynamics, and climate change risks.

:mega: I'm actively looking for work (Switzerland / remote) in these :point_up_2: areas with possible start date in early 2023.
